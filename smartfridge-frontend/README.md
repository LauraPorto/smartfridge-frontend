## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

This project addresses the Frontend part of the full stack project at the end of the GeeksHubs bootcamps. The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe job is to be able to easily search for recipes with the ingredients that are in your fridge. In this way, the different possibilities are offered to be able to find your ideal dish without effort, by means of a list of your foods to search.
In addition to this, there is also the option to explore the application and discover new recipes based on different criteria, such as diet (gluten, vegan, etc.), preparation in minutes or extended ingredients for said recipe. In addition, you can save all the recipes you want to favorites, so you can have quick access to your favorite dishes.


## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

In this frontend part of the project, a tour of the different functionalities of the application is offered, through the implementation of containers and components that allow a fluid user experience.
A search for multiple ingredients of different recipes is offered for registered users with all the necessary information (images, extended ingredients, diets ...), thus exploring different functionalities and results in relation to the indicated ingredients.


## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

There are some small limitations within this website. Thus, when searching for ingredients for recipes, the images that come from the API are not displayed.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

In the future, more functionalities will be implemented such as new search criteria or nutritional information for each ingredient individually, in addition to the one offered by the recipe. In addition, the recipes saved in favorites and the views reserved for the user role (Admin) can also be viewed.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to install the project, NodeJS must be installed, using the version 15.7.0 in this case. We start the project and all its dependencies using the command:

```
npm install
```

### Installing

Once the dependencies are installed, the project starts by running the command:

```
npm start
```


## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Without the need to register or log in, the user can navigate the Home view, explore the different recipes (without access to their information), as well as learn about the different services offered by the web. Of course, there is the option of logging in and out.
Once the user is registered, they will be able to access their personal space where their personal data will be saved, with the option to update and delete the account (in their profile view). In addition to this, and as a strong point of this website, the user can access their 'kitchen', where they will search for the ingredients they have at home or that they want to use to search for the recipe, in the 'Store' view '. From here, a results view will be offered with all the recipes that match the search, from which their details can be extracted, such as nutritional information, instructions, ingredients used and their measurements, as well as extra ingredients that are they might add. In addition, in this view ('Recipe Info'), you can also save your favorite recipes in the database, in order to have easy access to their information.
